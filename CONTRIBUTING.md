### Using a consistent coding style

A couple of notes to keep things consistent: 

- Variable and function names are generally all lowercase, separated by underscores where relevant. 
- For Matlab structures, the first letter of the variable name is capitalized (e.g., `Aggs` and `Imgs`).
- Variables composed of images are normally given names of the form `imgs_*`.
- Indenting is given by a tab.
