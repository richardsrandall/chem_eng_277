Notes on the workflow for ChemE 277:

- We've gotten rid of most of the built-in 'main' Matlab scripts to reduce clutter.
- There are now 4 main files, chem277_...
    > validation_process: run kmeans on the validation images
    > validation_postprocess: apply exclusions, generate histograms,
            and compare to Gibson's manually labeled results on validation data
    > all_data_process: run kmeans on all of the images
    > all_data_postprocess: apply exclusions, generate histograms on all data

- We auto-detect the scale bars, then manually override the ones that are wrong

- Diagnostic files that get generated along the way:
    > validate_scale_bar_detection: quickly check that OCR and SB detection is behaving
    > validate_object_detection: check how well aggregate and primary particle detection are working

- We auto-detect the aggregates and primary particles, then manually reject the bad ones

- Added 'chem277_empty_output_folders' to purge large images before Git pushes

- Folders within the 'data' folder (rename to TEM_data?): 
    > (TBD)

- Things that were found not to work:
    > Weighting the average Dp from an aggregate by the area.
    > Artificially boosting the grey threshold when detecting aggregates
