Notes on the workflow for ChemE 277:

- We've gotten rid of most of the built-in 'main' Matlab scripts to reduce clutter.
- There are now 4 main files, chem277_...
    > process: run kmeans on any of the three folders of images
    > validation_postprocess: apply exclusions, generate histograms,
            and compare to Gibson's manually labeled results on validation data
    > all_data_postprocess: apply exclusions, generate histograms on all data

- We auto-detect the scale bars, then manually override the ones that are wrong

- Diagnostic files that get generated along the way:
    > validate_scale_bar_detection: quickly check that OCR and SB detection is behaving
    > validate_object_detection: check how well aggregate and primary particle detection are working
    > validate_primary_particle_detection: show how Kook primary particle detection worked

- We auto-detect the aggregates and primary particles, then manually reject the bad ones
    > manual_image_checker.m provides a nice workflow for doing this
    > chopping off the scale bar and adding a black frame around the image edge worked nicely
    > Filtering for unphysical particles below a certain size seems to have helped
    > Manual filtering to reject bad images seems to have helped
    > Filtering only for certain image zoom levels definitely seems to have helped!

- Added 'chem277_empty_output_folders' to purge large images before Git pushes

- Folders within the 'data' folder: small_validation_data, validation_data, all_pyrolysis_data

- Things that were found not to work:
    > Weighting the average Dp from an aggregate by the area.
    > Artificially boosting the grey threshold when detecting aggregates
